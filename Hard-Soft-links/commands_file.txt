Step 1: Create a file

echo "This is original file" > original.txt

Step 2: Create a hard link

ln original.txt hardlink.txt

Step 3: Create a soft link

ln -s original.txt softlink.txt

Now check: ls -li

123456 -rw-r--r-- 2 user user 23 Jul 23 12:00 original.txt
123456 -rw-r--r-- 2 user user 23 Jul 23 12:00 hardlink.txt
123457 lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 13 Jul 23 12:00 softlink.txt -> original.txt


original.txt and hardlink.txt share the same inode (123456) ✔️

softlink.txt has different inode, but points to the path original.txt

Delete original: rm original.txt


Now check:

cat hardlink.txt    # ✅ Still works
cat softlink.txt    # ❌ Broken link (No such file or directory)
